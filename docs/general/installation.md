# Installation

### PHPStreamServer core
The core component is required to run PHPStreamServer.
It includes the core server functionality as well as the supervisor to manage worker processes.
```bash
$ composer require phpstreamserver/core
```

### PHPStreamServer plugins
To extend the functionality of PHPStreamServer, you can install additional [plugins](/docs/plugins/).  
Each plugin is optional, so you can choose only those that are relevant to your application.
